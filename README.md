<h2>üêò About Me:</h2>

- <i>Hello! I have worked in cyber for a little bit, taking a break from work to get some education under my belt!  From what I've seen in resumes, there doesn't seem to be enough room to convey "all the things", so I'll try to capture more of "all the things" here!  My career goal is to continue my education and find employment as a Tier 1 Analyst.</i>
